Content: Problem → Solution → ROI	
Shows: What & Why (conclusion)	

Presentation (Video)
9 minutes - Judges watch together
Goal: "Hire these smart people"
Content: Mystery → Investigation → Revelation → Solution
Shows: How & Why (journey)

  Decision:              Decision:
  "Fund it"    ←→        "Award them"
   
If both say the same thing:
❌ Why watch 9 min video after reading 2-min summary?
❌ Looks like you're wasting judges' time with repetition
❌ Shows poor strategic thinking

If they complement:
✅ Summary = business case (for execs)
✅ Video = proof of competence (for judges)
✅ Executive reads summary → watches video → amazed: "These people are thorough"
✅ Judge watches video → reads summary → impressed: "Not just brilliant, but business-smart"

📝 Your Writing Assignment (No Repetition)
EXEC SUMMARY should answer:
✅ What's the problem? (Cost: $890K/quarter loss)
✅ Why does it exist? (Process inefficiency, 50% vs 75% utilization)
✅ What's the fix? (3 tiers, 5 models, 12 weeks)
✅ What's the ROI? ($550K → $15.3M, 3.3-week payback)
❌ How did you discover it? (NO—that's video only)
❌ Why did other hypotheses fail? (NO—that's video only)

PRESENTATION should answer:
✅ How did you investigate? (Mystery → Test → Discover)
✅ Why is the solution smart? (System Theory proof)
✅ How do the models work? (Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.)
✅ Can you prove it? (2,179 events, real data, validation plots)
❌ What's the exact payback period? (NO—that's summary only)
❌ How many weeks for implementation? (NO—that's summary only)

the problem is "bottleneck," but cost is how you make executives CARE about the bottleneck
