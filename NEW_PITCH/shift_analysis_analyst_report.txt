Generated: 2025-11-09 16:50:17
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total patients analyzed: 15,000
Total bottleneck events: 3,812 (25.4%)
Day shift bottleneck concentration: 63.6%
Day shift utilization: 154.2%

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Morning Rush (7 AM-12 PM): 36.5% of all bottleneck events
   - 1,393 bottleneck events during peak hours
   - Average wait: 36.5 min

2. Early Morning (5-7 AM): 5.9% of all bottleneck events
   - 225 bottleneck events during transition period
   - Average wait: 36.0 min
   - Night shift tail (1.5-2 doctors + early morning arrivals)

3. Combined Early Morning Period (5 AM-12 PM): 42.4% of all bottleneck events
   - This 7-hour window concentrates 42% of all system stress
   - Early morning (5-7 AM): 225 events (transition/handoff)
   - Morning rush (7 AM-12 PM): 1,393 events (peak congestion)

DETAILED SHIFT BREAKDOWN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAY SHIFT
  Patients: 9,792
  Doctors on duty: 3.5
  Utilization: 154.2%
  Average wait: 38.3 min
  Bottleneck events: 2,424 (63.6% of total)
  Throughput: 3.85 pph

EVENING SHIFT
  Patients: 2,986
  Doctors on duty: 3.5
  Utilization: 46.8%
  Average wait: 41.5 min
  Bottleneck events: 976 (25.6% of total)
  Throughput: 1.17 pph

NIGHT SHIFT
  Patients: 2,222
  Doctors on duty: 1.5
  Utilization: 79.8%
  Average wait: 35.8 min
  Bottleneck events: 412 (10.8% of total)
  Throughput: 1.99 pph

EARLY MORNING (5-7 AM) - TRANSITION PERIOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visits: 1,219
Bottleneck events: 225
Bottleneck rate: 18.5% (within period)
Average wait: 36.0 min
Peak hour: 6:00 AM
Context: End of night shift (1.5-2 doctors) + early patient arrivals
Significance: Transition bottleneck before day shift handoff

MORNING RUSH (7 AM - 12 PM) - PEAK PERIOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visits: 6,779
Bottleneck events: 1,393
Bottleneck rate: 20.5% (within period)
Average wait: 36.5 min
Peak hour: 8:00 AM
Context: Day shift operational (3.5-4 doctors) at highest load
Significance: Core bottleneck period - main constraint point

COMBINED EARLY MORNING ANALYSIS (5 AM - 12 PM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total visits: 7,998
Total bottleneck events: 1,618
Total bottleneck % of day shift: 66.7%
Total bottleneck % of all events: 42.4%
Strategic insight: This 7-hour window concentrates 42% of ALL system bottlenecks
Key finding: Two distinct problems (transition + peak) in same window

KEY POINTS FOR VIDEO SCRIPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ "Day shift operates at 154% utilization (overloaded with only 3.5 doctors)"
✓ "Evening: 47% (ideal), Night: 80% (acceptable)"
✓ "64% of all bottleneck events concentrated in day shift"
✓ "Early morning period (5 AM-12 PM) accounts for 42.4% of all bottlenecks"
✓ "Early morning transition (5-7 AM): 225 events = 5.9% of bottlenecks"
✓ "Morning rush peak (7 AM-12 PM): 1,393 events = 36.5% of bottlenecks"
✓ "Two distinct problems in early morning window:"
  - "5-7 AM: Transition period with minimal night shift staff"
  - "7 AM-12 PM: Peak patient arrival with insufficient day shift doctors"
✓ "Average wait time: Day 38m, Evening 42m, Night 36m"
✓ "Critical insight: Staffing transition (1.5 night doctors → 3.5 day doctors)"

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EARLY MORNING STAFFING (5 AM - 12 PM)
   - Highest concentration of bottlenecks (42% in 7-hour window)
   - Consider staggered start: Add 1-2 doctors at 5 AM (before full 4-doctor day shift)

2. PRIORITIZE DAY SHIFT (Highest ROI)
   - 64% of problem occurs here
   - Even small improvements yield large absolute impact

3. ADDRESS TRANSITION PERIOD (5-7 AM)
   - 225 bottleneck events in this window
   - Currently: Only 2 night-shift doctors, then abrupt handoff at 7 AM
   - Solution: Overlap staffing or earlier day-shift start

2. FOCUS ON MORNING HOURS (7 AM - 12 PM)
   - Peak congestion time
   - Queue management critical

3. SHIFT-AWARE STAFFING
   - Day: Increase to 75% target (gap: -79 points)
   - Evening: Moderate increase (gap: 28 points)
   - Night: Acceptable (already at 80%)
