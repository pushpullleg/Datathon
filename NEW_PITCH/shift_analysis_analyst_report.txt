SHIFT-AWARE ANALYST REPORT: ER PATIENT FLOW ANALYSIS
Generated: 2025-11-09 16:50:17
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total patients analyzed: 15,000
Total bottleneck events: 3,812 (25.4%)
Day shift bottleneck concentration: 63.6%
Day shift utilization: 154.2%

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Morning Rush (7 AM-12 PM): 36.5% of all bottleneck events
   - 1,393 bottleneck events during peak hours
   - Average wait: 36.5 min

2. Pre-Morning Rush (5-7 AM): 5.9% of all events
   - 225 bottleneck events during transition
   - Average wait: 36.0 min
   - Night shift tail (2 doctors + early morning arrivals)

3. Combined Early Morning (5 AM-12 PM): 42.4% of all events
   - This 7-hour window concentrates the core problem
- Day shift operates at only 154% utilization
- Target utilization: 75% (gap: -79 points)

DETAILED SHIFT BREAKDOWN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAY SHIFT
  Patients: 9,792
  Doctors on duty: 3.5
  Utilization: 154.2%
  Average wait: 38.3 min
  Bottleneck events: 2,424 (63.6% of total)
  Throughput: 3.85 pph

EVENING SHIFT
  Patients: 2,986
  Doctors on duty: 3.5
  Utilization: 46.8%
  Average wait: 41.5 min
  Bottleneck events: 976 (25.6% of total)
  Throughput: 1.17 pph

NIGHT SHIFT
  Patients: 2,222
  Doctors on duty: 1.5
  Utilization: 79.8%
  Average wait: 35.8 min
  Bottleneck events: 412 (10.8% of total)
  Throughput: 1.99 pph

MORNING RUSH DEEP DIVE (7 AM - 12 PM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Morning rush visits: 6,779
Morning rush bottleneck events: 1,393
Average wait during morning rush: 36.5 min
Peak congestion: Highest utilization period

PRE-MORNING RUSH DEEP DIVE (5 AM - 7 AM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-morning visits: 1,219
Pre-morning bottleneck events: 225
Average wait during pre-morning: 36.0 min
Context: End of night shift (2 doctors) + early arrivals
Significance: Transition period before day shift begins

COMBINED EARLY MORNING ANALYSIS (5 AM - 12 PM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total early morning visits: 7,998
Total early morning bottlenecks: 1,618 (42.4% of all events)
Strategic insight: This 7-hour window is the critical constraint
Staffing challenge: Transition from 2 doctors (night) → 4 doctors (day)

KEY POINTS FOR VIDEO SCRIPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ "Seventy-five percent of 3,812 bottleneck events occurred during day shift"
✓ "Day shift operates at 154% utilization (only 4 doctors)"
✓ "Evening: 47%, Night: 80%"
✓ "Morning rush (7 AM-12 PM) is the critical constraint"
✓ "Pre-morning transition (5-7 AM) adds 225 additional bottleneck events"
✓ "Combined early morning (5 AM-12 PM) concentrates 42% of all inefficiency"
✓ "Average wait time: Day 38m, Evening 42m, Night 36m"
✓ "Critical insight: Staffing transition (2→4 doctors) at 5-7 AM creates early bottleneck"

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EARLY MORNING STAFFING (5 AM - 12 PM)
   - Highest concentration of bottlenecks (42% in 7-hour window)
   - Consider staggered start: Add 1-2 doctors at 5 AM (before full 4-doctor day shift)

2. PRIORITIZE DAY SHIFT (Highest ROI)
   - 64% of problem occurs here
   - Even small improvements yield large absolute impact

3. ADDRESS TRANSITION PERIOD (5-7 AM)
   - 225 bottleneck events in this window
   - Currently: Only 2 night-shift doctors, then abrupt handoff at 7 AM
   - Solution: Overlap staffing or earlier day-shift start

2. FOCUS ON MORNING HOURS (7 AM - 12 PM)
   - Peak congestion time
   - Queue management critical

3. SHIFT-AWARE STAFFING
   - Day: Increase to 75% target (gap: -79 points)
   - Evening: Moderate increase (gap: 28 points)
   - Night: Acceptable (already at 80%)
