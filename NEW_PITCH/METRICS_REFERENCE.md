# Quick Reference: Bottleneck Metrics (CORRECTED)

## Metric Definitions (FIXED TERMINOLOGY)

### Early Morning Transition (5 AM - 7 AM)
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Staffing:** 1.5 night doctors
- **Visits:** 1,219
- **Bottleneck events:** 225
- **% of total bottlenecks:** 5.9%
- **Average wait:** 36.0 min

### Morning Rush Peak (7 AM - 12 PM)
- **Duration:** 5 hours
- **Staffing:** 3.5 day doctors
- **Visits:** 6,779
- **Bottleneck events:** 1,393
- **% of total bottlenecks:** 36.5%
- **Average wait:** 36.5 min

### Combined Early Morning (5 AM - 12 PM)
- **Duration:** 7 hours
- **Total visits:** 7,998
- **Total bottlenecks:** 1,618
- **% of total bottlenecks:** 42.4%
- **Components:** 225 (transition) + 1,393 (peak)

## Key Numbers for Your Pitch

✅ **Use these exact numbers:**
- "Early morning (5-7 AM) transition: 225 bottleneck events"
- "Morning rush peak (7 AM-12 PM): 1,393 bottleneck events"
- "Combined (5 AM-12 PM): 1,618 events = 42.4% of ALL bottlenecks"
- "Day shift utilization: 154% (overloaded)"
- "Early morning alone represents 5.9% of total system stress"
- "Morning rush alone represents 36.5% of total system stress"

❌ **DO NOT say:**
- "Early morning crisis 5 AM-12 PM" (that's combining two different problems)
- "42% in early morning" without explaining it's two periods

✅ **DO say:**
- "Early morning period (5 AM-12 PM) accounts for 42% of bottlenecks"
  - "5-7 AM transition: 225 events (5.9%)"
  - "7 AM-12 PM morning rush: 1,393 events (36.5%)"
- "Two distinct problems in this window create a compounding crisis"

## Video Script Talking Points

### Problem Statement:
> "The hospital's most critical constraint occurs in early morning, 5 AM to noon. This 7-hour window contains 42% of ALL system bottlenecks. But it's not a single problem—it's two compounding challenges."

### Challenge 1 (5-7 AM):
> "First, there's a staffing transition crisis. At 5 AM, only 1.5 night-shift doctors are on duty, but patients start arriving early. Over 2 hours, we see 225 bottleneck events as the minimal night staff gets overwhelmed. This 18.5% bottleneck rate in this period indicates a scheduling issue."

### Challenge 2 (7 AM-12 PM):
> "Then, the morning rush explodes. Day shift starts with 3.5 doctors, but the patient volume is so high that the system runs at 154% capacity. In just 5 hours, 1,393 bottleneck events occur—36.5% of the hospital's daily problems. Peak congestion hits at 8 AM."

### Combined Impact:
> "Together, these two 'morning crises' represent 1,618 bottleneck events, or 42% of all system inefficiency. Addressing this window alone would eliminate nearly half the hospital's bottlenecks."

## Why This Breakdown Matters

**Before (Wrong):**
- "Early morning 5 AM-12 PM: 42% of bottlenecks"
- (Confuses two separate problems as one)

**After (Right):**
- "Early morning transition (5-7 AM): 225 events, 5.9%"
- "Morning rush peak (7 AM-12 PM): 1,393 events, 36.5%"
- "Combined window: 42.4% of bottlenecks"
- (Shows clear structure: transition problem + capacity problem)

This allows you to propose **targeted solutions** for each problem instead of one generic fix.
