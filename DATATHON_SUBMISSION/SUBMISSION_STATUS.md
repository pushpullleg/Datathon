## 🎬 NEXT STEPS: HOW TO SUBMIT

### STEP 1: RECORD THE VIDEO (Today, ~90 minutes)

**Preparation (15 min):**
- Read the Voiceover_Script.txt file
- Do a rehearsal: Consultant reads opening 30 sec
- Test Zoom, microphones, lighting, backgrounds

**Recording (30 min):**
- Start Zoom recording + local backups
- Follow the 6 segments from the script
- Consultant → Analyst → Scientist → back to Consultant → all three together

**Quality Check (10 min):**
- Review audio: Clear and understandable?
- Review timing: 9:30 total? ✅
- Any re-records needed? Do them now

**Post-Production (35 min):**
- Clean audio (noise reduction, normalize)
- Edit video: Sync audio + slides + titles + credits
- Export as MP4 (1080p, H.264)
- Final quality check: Watch entire video

**Result:** Meridian_ER_Datathon_Video.mp4 (ready to submit)
