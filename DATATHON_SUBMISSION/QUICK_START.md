### Golden Rules
- ✅ Pause 5 sec between segments (easier to edit)
- ✅ If you stumble: Pause 5 sec, re-read last sentence, continue
- ✅ Don't restart entire segment for one mistake
- ✅ Stay focused (no side conversations)
- ✅ Audio is PRIORITY (if cuts out, pause, rejoin, continue)
- ✅ Watch timing (should match script exactly)

### Quality Checks Between Segments
- Audio clear?
- Timing correct?
- Confidence high?
- Ready for next segment? → Go!
