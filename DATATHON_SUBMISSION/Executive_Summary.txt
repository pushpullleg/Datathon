MERIDIAN CITY HOSPITAL ER OPTIMIZATION
Executive Summary

PROBLEM
Meridian's Emergency Department operates at 6.9 patients per hour despite theoretical capacity of 8-10 patients per hour. Analysis of 15,000 Q1 2025 visits reveals 85% of total ED time consumed by post-triage wait (39 minutes, 23%) and doctor cycle time (107 minutes, 62%). Current physician productivity (2.1 patients/hour/doctor) falls below industry average (2.5), representing significant optimization opportunity.

DISCOVERY  
Contrary to assumptions, the bottleneck is not solely physician shortage. Time-stamped analysis—accounting for realistic 10-minute transition time between patients—identified 2,179 instances (14.5% of visits) where doctors were idle while patients waited simultaneously. Utilization during these moments: 50% versus industry target 75-80%. This reveals two distinct problems requiring different solutions.

TWO SITUATIONS

Situation 1 | Process Inefficiency (2,179 bottleneck events)
─ Root causes: Manual assignment, lack of queue visibility, shift handoff gaps
─ Solution: Real-time dashboard, intelligent assignment protocol, standardized handoffs
─ Timeline: 30-90 days; Investment: $35-50K
─ Impact: Utilization 50%→65-70%; recover 800+ wasted patient-hours quarterly; $265K annual benefit

Situation 2 | Day Shift Capacity Crisis (154% utilization)  
─ Evidence: Day demand 13.6 pph vs capacity 8.75 pph (mathematical impossibility)
─ Root cause: 65% of daily volume concentrated in 8-hour window with same staffing as low-volume evening shift (47% utilized)
─ Solution: Add 0.7-1.0 FTE physician targeting morning peak (7 AM-12 PM); redistribute resources
─ Timeline: 12-week recruitment + 8-week onboarding; Investment: $175-230K annually  
─ Impact: Reduce day utilization 154%→80-90%; eliminate structural deficit; $720K annual benefit

INTEGRATED STRATEGY
Process optimization alone plateaus at 65-70% (insufficient to address 154% day shift crisis). Staffing expansion without workflow fixes wastes resources. Both together achieve sustainable 75-80% utilization. Phased approach: Process improvements (Weeks 1-4) build credibility and quick wins while parallel physician recruitment proceeds. Combined deployment (Month 4-5) produces full optimization.

FINANCIAL IMPACT (Conservative Scenario)
Total investment: $210-280K (Year 1)
Year 1 benefit: $985K (Process: $265K + Capacity: $720K)  
Payback period: 3.2 months
ROI: 252% Year 1; sustained $985K annually thereafter
Additional benefits: Staff retention, patient satisfaction, market differentiation

RECOMMENDATION  
Deploy immediately with decision gates: Launch process improvements Week 1; begin recruitment Week 2. Gate at Week 4 (process gains validation) and Week 8 (recruitment progress check) enables course adjustment. This de-risked approach validates hypotheses, maximizes value, and addresses both root causes systematically.

METHODOLOGY NOTE: Analysis based on Q1 2025 data with conservative assumptions including 10-minute physician transition buffer between patients. Focused on physician workflow; assumes adequate downstream resources (beds, nursing, diagnostics).
