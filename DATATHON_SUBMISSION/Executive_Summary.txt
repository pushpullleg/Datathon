MERIDIAN CITY HOSPITAL ER OPTIMIZATION
Executive Summary

PROBLEM
Meridian's Emergency Department operates at 6.9 patient visits per hour despite physician capacity of 10+. Analysis of 15,000 Q1 2025 patient visits reveals that 85% of total ED time is consumed by post-triage wait (39 minutes, 23%) and doctor cycle time (107 minutes, 62%). This 25% capacity gap costs the hospital $890,000 quarterly.

DISCOVERY
Contrary to assumptions, the bottleneck is not physician shortage. Data analysis identified 2,179 instances (14.5% of visits) where doctors were idle while patients waited simultaneously. Utilization during these moments: 50% versus industry target of 75-80%. System Theory confirms: the constraint is patient flow optimization, not staff availability.

TWO DISTINCT SITUATIONS

Situation 1 | Process Inefficiency (2,179 idle doctor moments)
─ Root causes: Manual assignment (40%), lack of visibility (30%), shift chaos (20%), inefficiency (10%)
─ Solution: Queue dashboard, intelligent assignment protocol, standardized handoffs
─ Timeline: 30-90 days; Investment: <$50K
─ Expected benefit: Utilization 50%→70%; $300K+ quarterly revenue gain

Situation 2 | Capacity Crisis (154% day shift utilization)
─ Evidence: Day shift demand 13.6 patients/hour exceeds capacity 8.75 patients/hour
─ Root cause: Mathematical—volume exceeds capacity, not a process issue
─ Solution: Add 1-2 physicians to morning hours; redistribute evening staff (currently 47% utilized)
─ Timeline: 12 weeks recruitment + 8 weeks onboarding; Investment: $225K annually
─ Expected benefit: 75-80% sustainable utilization; $720K incremental annual revenue

INTEGRATED APPROACH
Process optimization alone reaches 70% ceiling. Staffing alone deploys resources inefficiently. Both together achieve 75-80% sustainable operations with maximum ROI. Three-tier implementation: Weeks 1-4 (dashboard + protocol), Weeks 5-8 (system redesign), Weeks 9-12 (full deployment + new physician).

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Total investment: $550K (Tiers 1-3)
Year 1 benefit: $15.3M (7,500 additional patient visits)
Payback period: 3.3 weeks
Year 1 ROI: 2,662%
Year 2+ sustainable: $1.9M annually

RECOMMENDATION
Deploy immediately with contingency planning: if models improve wait time <10% by Week 4, pivot to staffing; if results lag, weekly retraining protocol. Implementation gates at Weeks 4 and 8 enable decisive course adjustment. This approach balances risk, validates hypotheses, and maximizes value.
